# Code for the analysis of proportions in ecology, using binomial regression

This code was provided as a supplementary material in Warton, D.I. and Hui, F.K.C. (2011), The arcsine is asinine: the analysis of proportions in ecology. Ecology, 92: 3-10. doi: [10.1890/10-0340.1](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/10-0340.1). It shows how to perform analyses of proportions using binomial regressions instead of using arcsin square root transformations, and the former approach outperforms the latter. This code is just for my reference, all the credits should go to the authors. It can also be found [here](https://figshare.com/articles/Supplement_1_R_code_demonstrating_how_to_fit_a_logistic_regression_model_with_a_random_intercept_term_and_how_to_use_resampling-based_hypothesis_testing_for_inference_/3550407).
